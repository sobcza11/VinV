## 🧭 Overview
Value-in-Vogue (VinV) investigates whether long-horizon dividend durability is a reliable indicator of value-style leadership across shifting macro-economic regimes.

Originally informed by post-2021 market dynamics, VinV has been generalized into a broader, institution-grade research model positioned within the OracleChambers. It supports structured macro-state inference, factor drift tracking, and long-cycle analysis under combinations of:

- slow or contracting growth  
- persistent inflation or cost pressures  
- volatility clusters  
- liquidity constraints  
- regime inflection points  

VinV is designed as a durable research component within the OracleChambers ecosystem.

## 📘 Description
The central research question:

> **Do U.S. equities that have maintained or raised dividends for ~30 years reliably exhibit value-style resilience across stressed market regimes?**

To evaluate this, VinV constructs a dataset of U.S.-listed equities that have **never reduced dividends since January 1990**.  
This enables:

- dividend durability as a proxy for balance-sheet strength  
- long-run value identification beyond price ratios  
- historical regime testing  
- performance comparison to the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (`IWD`) during volatility events  

### CPMAI Alignment
VinV adheres to CPMAI methodology for transparent and reproducible research:

- **Phase I — Business Understanding:** Define the value-equity inquiry and the role of dividend stability.  
- **Phase II — Data Understanding:** Validate sources (ex: WRDS), historical coverage, granularity, and limitations.  
- **Phase III — Data Preparation:** Clean, validate, and structure the dividend-durability dataset using governance controls.  
- **Phase IV — Modeling:** Apply regime segmentation, volatility slicing, and factor comparison to IWD.  
- **Phase V — Evaluation:** Interpret VinV signal behavior across economic states.  
- **Phase VI — Operationalization (Future):** Integrate VinV outputs as a module within the OracleChambers.
